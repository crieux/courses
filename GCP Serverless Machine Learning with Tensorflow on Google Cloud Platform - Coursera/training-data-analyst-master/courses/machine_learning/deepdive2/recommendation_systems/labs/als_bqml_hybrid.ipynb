    "### Incorporating user and movie information \n",
    "The matrix factorization approach does not use any information about users or movies beyond what is available from the ratings matrix. However, we will often have user information (such as the city they live, their annual income, their annual expenditure, etc.) and we will almost always have more information about the products in our catalog. How do we incorporate this information in our recommendation model?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer lies in recognizing that the user factors and product factors that result from the matrix factorization approach end up being a concise representation of the information about users and products available from the ratings matrix. We can concatenate this information with other information we have available and train a regression model to predict the rating.\n",
    "### Obtaining user and product factors\n",
    "We can get the user factors or product factors from ML.WEIGHTS. For example to get the product factors for movieId=96481 and user factors for userId=54192, we would do:\n"
